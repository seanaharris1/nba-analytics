Data scraping and analysis on NBA teams via data from basketball-reference.com

# Introduction
I will be using pandas, BeautifulSoup, numpy, and matplotlib libraries to pull and analyze statistics of NBA teams and players using data from the basketball-reference.com. I will be adding several different scripts doing different types of data analytics and will be glad to take any suggestions on what kind of analysis to perform

# South Beach Flu
The first script I am writing will investigate (and hopefully validate) the myth of the "South Beach Flu", wherein opposing NBA teams, when visiting Miami (if they did not play the night before) will perform worse because they enjoyed a night on South Beach the night before (hence the name "South Beach Flu"). 

I will be compare statistics like team PPG, team turnovers, team PPG allowed to the team's average and try to identify a trend. I will also perform the same analysis on teams in other major cities such as the New York Knicks, Brooklyn Nets, LA Clippers, and LA Lakers.
